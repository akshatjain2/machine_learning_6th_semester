The basic commands are as follows.

Comments: # symbol is being used for comments in python. For multiline comments, you have to use “”” symbols or enclosing the comment in the “”” symbol.
Example:
print “Hello World” # this is the comment section.

Example:
“”” This is Hello world project.”””

Type function: These Python Commands are used to check the type of variable and used inbuilt functions to check.
Example:
type (20), its type is int.
>>> type (20) < type ‘int’ >

Example:
type (-1 +j), its type is complex
>>> type (-1+j)
< type ‘complex’ >

Strings: It is mainly enclosed in double-quotes.
Example:
type (“hello World”), type is string
>>> type (“hello World”)
< type ‘str’ >

Lists: Lists are mainly enclosed in square bracket.
Example:
type ( [ 1, 2 ] ), type is list
>>> type ( [ 1, 2, 3 ] )
< type ‘List’ >

Tuple: Tuple are mainly enclosed in parenthesis.
Example:
type ( 1, 2, 3), a type is a tuple.
>>> type ( ( 1, 2, 3) )
<type ‘tuple’ >

Range: This function is used to create the list of integers.
Example:
>>> range ( 10 )
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Example:
>>> range (1,10)
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Boolean values: This data type helps in retrieving the data in True or false form.
Example:
>>> True
True
>>> type (True)
< type ‘bool’ >

Example:
>>> False
False
>>> type (False)
< type ‘bool’ >

Operator: Different operator is used for the different functions like division, multiply, addition and subtraction.
Example:
>>> 16/2
8
Example: 
>>> 2 * * ½
1

Variable and assignment: The assignment statement has variable = expression. Single ‘=’ is used for assignment, and double ‘= =’ is used to test for quality.
Example:
>>> X= 235
>>> print X
235
>>> Z= 2* X
>>> print Z
470

Comparison operators: To compare the two values and the result of the comparison is always boolean value.
Example:
>>> 2 < 3
True


Conditional/ decisions: It is used to make out the decision between two or more values like if-else
Example:
if x=0:
Print “Hello, world.”
Else:
Print “Hello, world in Else.”

For Loop: This Python command is used when iteration and action consist of the same elements.
Example:
for x in [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:
Print x;

While loop: While loop will never be executed if the condition evaluates to false for the first time.
Example:
x =0
while x<10:
Print x,
X= x+2

Else in loop: Loop have optional else for execution.
Example:
for x in [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]:
Print x
Else:
Print “In Else”

Break, continue statement: break statement is used to exit out the loop when particular output is achieved; continue is used to continue with the next iteration of a loop.
Example:
if x==0:
Print “X is 0”
Break
Else:
Print “X is greater than 0.”

Lists: It is the finite number of items, and by assigning a value to list the list value will get changed.
Example:
>>> a = [1, “JAY”, 34] >>> a [0] 1
>>> a [0] = 101
>>> a
[101, “JAY”, 34]

Length of list: To know the length if list.
Example:
>>> X = [1, 4, 67,9] >>> len (X)
4

Sublists: It will give you the values between the mentioned start index and the end index.
Example:
x [start : end] >>> X [1, 3, 4,6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 2] >>> X [2:5] [4, 6, 7]

Joining two list: + operator is being used to concatenate 2 lists.
Example:
>>> [2, 1, 5] + [0, 4,6,7] [2, 1, 5, 0, 4, 6,7]

Strings: It is used to check the index to know the character written in string.
Example:
>>> x= “hello, world”
>>> x [2] ‘l’
>>> x [5] ‘o’
