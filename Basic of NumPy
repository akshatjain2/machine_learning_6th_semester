NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

Types of Array:
One Dimensional Array
Multi-Dimensional Array
One Dimensional Array:
A one-dimensional array is a type of linear array.
# importing numpy module
import numpy as np

# creating list
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# creating numpy array
sample_array = np.array(list1)

print("List in python : ", list)

print("Numpy Array in python :",
	sample_array)

Output:

List in python :  [1, 2, 3, 4]
Numpy Array in python :  [1 2 3 4]

Multi-Dimensional Array:
Data in multidimensional arrays are stored in tabular form.

# importing numpy module
import numpy as np

# creating list
list_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list_2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]
list_3 = [9, 10, 11, 12]

# creating numpy array
sample_array = np.array([list_1,
						list_2,
						list_3])

print("Numpy multi dimensional array in python\n",
	sample_array)
Output:

Numpy multi dimensional array in python
[[ 1  2  3  4]
 [ 5  6  7  8]
 [ 9 10 11 12]]
 
 # Import module
import numpy as np

# Creating the array
sample_array_1 = np.array([[0, 4, 2]])

sample_array_2 = np.array([0.2, 0.4, 2.4])

# display data type
print("Data type of the array 1 :",
	sample_array_1.dtype)

print("Data type of array 2 :",
	sample_array_2.dtype)

Output: 

Data type of the array 1 :  int32
Data type of array 2 :  float64
